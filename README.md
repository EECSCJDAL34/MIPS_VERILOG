# MIPS_VERILOG


Labs: 	

Part I: MIPS Assembly & Machine Languages

    Lab A: Representing Data in Binary
    Lab B: Translating Code to Assembly
    Lab C: Translating Utility Classes: The Stack
    Lab D: Translating Objects: The Heap 


Part II: Datapath & Control through Verilog HDL

    Lab K: Basic Verilog Programming
    Lab L: Hardware Building Blocks
    Lab M: Building the CPU
    Lab N: Automating the Control 

MIPS Simulator: 

The simulator reads instructions one by one and executes them. Execution of the instructions means changing the contents of registers and/or memory. The simulator runs until the end of the file (executable binary), or until executing a syscall.
